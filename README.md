**CS350 Emerging Systems, Architectures, and Technologies** (embedded systems w/ raspberry pi4 and grovepi+)

In this class, we explored emerging systems, architectures, and technologies with a focus on hardware/software interface. Utilizing the Raspberry Pi embedded system and the GrovePi+ sensor kit, we wrote specific software to interface with the embedded system and control hardware and software components. The following is the final milestone and the final project for this class. These submissions are a culmination of previous milestones which can be found in this repository: https://github.com/bkoconnell/cs350-milestones

**Milestone 4 - DHT Sensor & Web Dashboard**

This milestone builds off the milestone 2 software with the DHT (digitial humidity & temperature) sensor, but incorporates the use of a web dashboard to display the JSON data.
